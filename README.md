Bri11iant is a VSCode Language Extension for scaffolding accessible web development. Bri11iant fits right into your text editor, suggesting improvements to your HTML and CSS code in order to improve the accessibility of your websites.

When a webpage is rendered by your browser's rendering engine, the DOM and CSSOM are combined into a render tree, which is then painted onto the screen. Bri11iant works by parsing your HTML and CSS documents to construct its own *virtual render tree* so that it can provide more nuanced accessibility feedback that depends on parent-to-child interactions and page layout.
