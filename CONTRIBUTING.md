# Contributing to Bri11iant

Bri11iant is an open-source language extension created by researchers at the [Northwestern University Inclusive Technology Lab](https://inclusive.northwestern.edu) under NSF 1901456.

We welcome contributions of all kinds from filing issues and bug or typo fixes to large feature implementations. 

If you have ideas or want to start working on a contribution, [file an issue](https://github.com/InclusiveTechNU/Bri11iant/issues/new) and 
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/InclusiveTechNU/Bri11iant/compare). After it has been
reviewed and approved by a [commiter](https://github.com/InclusiveTechNU/Bri11iant/blob/master/CODEOWNERS), your changes will slide right into `master`. When you file your 10th commit, you will automatically be considered for 
committer status and will be able to work right in the repository with the other members of the Bri11iant team.

Have an A11Y standard you want us to support? Submit a PR to our [standards repository](https://github.com/InclusiveTechNU/A11yGrammar)!

**Note on code style guidelines:**

All code must pass standard [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) guidelines.
The linter will be run upon compiling the project:
