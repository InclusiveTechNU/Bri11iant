## V11 Coding Standards

This document provides guidance for the kind of code that should go in to
the V11 project. The rules in this document will allow us to scale the
project and ensure that the code base remains readable and maintainable.

### Use the LLVM coding standards

The project uses the LLVM coding standards for C++ code:

  '''
  http://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html
  '''

The compiler uses the LLVM data structures, described in the link below. The
LLVM data structures and utilities are efficient, well documented and battle
hardened. Use them.

  '''
  http://llvm.org/docs/ProgrammersManual.html
  '''

The project uses a reasonable subset of C++11. Just like LLVM, V11 does
not use exceptions and RTTI.

### Small incremental changes

The project is developed using small incremental changes. These changes can be
small bug fixes or minor tweaks. Other times, these changes are small steps
along the path to reaching larger stated goals. Long-term development branches
suffer from many problems, including the lack of visibility, difficulty of code
review, lack of testing of the branch and merge difficulty.

Commits that go into the project need to be reviewable. This means that commits
need to be relatively small, well documented and self contained.

### Add tests

Functional changes to the compiler need to include a testcase. Unit tests and
regression tests are critical to the qualification of the compiler. Every bug
fix needs to include a testcase.

Reduce test cases as much as possible! It is unacceptable to commit big programs
because they do not describe the essence of the failure, they are fragile, and
they slow testing down. Tests need to be short and focused.

### Format your code

We encourage the use of clang-format to enforce code style and formatting.
Commits that only change the formatting of code should go in independent of
functional changes.

### Commit messages

Here are some guidelines about the format of the commit message:

Separate the commit message into a single-line title and a separate body that
describes the change. Make the title short (80 chars) and readable.  In changes
that are restricted to a specific part of the code, include a [tag] at the start
of the line in square brackets—for example, “[docs] ... ”.

If the commit fixes an issue in the bug tracking system, include a link or a
task number.

When reverting a change make sure to add a short note that describes why the
patch is being reverted.


### Code review

The project relies heavily on code review to maintain the software quality.

Review other people’s changes! Anybody is allowed to review code and comment
on patches.

All changes, by all developers, must be reviewed before they are committed to
the repository. Smaller changes (if the developer is the de-facto owner of the
code base) can be reviewed after being committed.
