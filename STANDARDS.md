# A11Y Standards

This markdown file contains a list of the web accessibility standards currently supported by Bri11iant. For established standards, we enforce WCAG2 rules. We also enforce several standards that are not covered by WCAG and are specific to page structure best practices and screen reader usability.

Bri11iant is an opinionated software - we throw errors for WCAG2 Level A violations and warnings for Level AA. These can be configured in the extension settings.
