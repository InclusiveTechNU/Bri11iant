# A11Y Standards

This markdown file contains a list of the web accessibility standards currently supported by Bri11iant. We try to stick with WCAG2 standards as well as some extras regarding screen reader compatibility.

Bri11iant is an opinionated software - we have decided to enforce WCAG2 Level A compliance and suggest WCAG Level B. All code that is found not to comply with WCAG2 Level A will be displayed as an *error*, while code that complies with Level A but not level B will be shown as a *warning*. These levels can be changed in the extension settings.
